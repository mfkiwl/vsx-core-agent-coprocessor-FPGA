Nearist greatly accelerates big data searches through a revolutionary new hardware platform specifically engineered to handle the computationally demanding task of performing Nearest Neighbor Search on vector representations of contentâ€”enabling your search routines to deliver results several orders of magnitude faster than anything else on the market.

## Structure
This repository conatains the RTL for the (21) lfe5u-85f-8bg381i on Nearist's VSX board. More information about the VSX board can be found !!!here!!! and can be purchased !!!here!!!

- `/bin/` contains the Xilinx Vivado constraint file for the design. Anything you would like to know about pin mapping or any constraints we put on place/route can be found here.
- `/lib/`contains the all the preconfigured Xilinx IP blocks used in the design. see !!!Getting Started!!! for more information.
- `/rtl/` contains the source code of the controller FPGA that connects the host to the various devices on the VSX but primarily the distance calculation engine (DCE).
- '/run/' The last folder in the repository is a folder dedicated for the project folders of all the configurations and/or simulations you build
## Module Hiearchy
see below diagram for a high level view of the design, for more information go to the !!!VSX Design Introduction!!!.

!!!TODO: Add diagram!!!

## Synthesis & Place/Route 
To build the design one must have the Xilinx Vivado(!!!link!!!) development environment installed on your PC

when creating a new project the following items are required:
  - constraint file 
  - top module and parallel communication interface
  - select common files required for the desired DCE and slot configuration
  - the xilinx IP core blocks

for further information about building the design go the !!!Getting Started!!! wiki page
